Performed data augmentation and segmentation on a medical (skin lesion) dataset and satellite images for remote-sensing using the UNet model architecture, and implemented a [Boundary-Aware Transformer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l_Iv5zFPwAfyK0G_FD9yb3e0tYcLOj0m/view?usp=sharing) model to segment ambiguous skin-lesion boundaries and achieved a 90% dice score.
